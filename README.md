# Design-Patterns-in-Java Using One Mega Problem Statement i.e "Setting Up of a Car Company"
All 23 Gang of four Design Patterns implemented in Java 

*Whats So SPECIAL* : 
When i was preparing for interview, I could not find a single problem statement that will use all the design patterns. So when i can remember that problem statement, i can revise all the design pattern at once. So, I set out to create that Mega Problem and came up with "Setting Up of a Car Company".
All the patterns are implemented using one Mega problem statement i.e Setting up of a Car Company Which involves creating a Car factory in a city that has different models of cars; have showrooms in different cities; Headquarter somewhere; car manufacturing process and Hierarchy of Employee that has different job within the car company.
