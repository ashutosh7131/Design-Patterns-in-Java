# Design-Patterns-in-Java (Using One Mega Problem Statement i.e "Setting Up of a Car Company")
All 23 Gang of four Design Patterns implemented in Java 

*Whats So SPECIAL* : 
When i was preparing for interview, I could not find a single problem statement that will use all the design patterns. So when i can remember that problem statement, i can revise all the design pattern at once. So, I set out to create that Mega Problem and came up with "Setting Up of a Car Company".
All the patterns are implemented using one Mega problem statement i.e Setting up of a Car Company Which involves creating a Car factory in a city that has different models of cars; have showrooms in different cities; Headquarter somewhere; car manufacturing process and Hierarchy of Employee that has different job within the car company.

Following are the features in our problem statement :

1. In our new Car Artificial Intelligence software, there is a possibility of virus from other hackers.There are different levels of virus and based on that level, employees can solve or not solve it. So, we have a team of developers and there is a hierarchy of developers. So, when there is a virus found in the system, it is given to the engineer. If he can not solve it, then he will pass it to team lead; if team lead cant then he will pass it to technical officer;etc. ( CHAIN_OF_RESPONSIBILITY ).
